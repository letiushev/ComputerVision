This OpenCV project covers the following topics: 
  - Billateral 
  - Joint Billateral 
  - Joint Billateral Upsampling 
  - Iterative Joint Upsampling 
  - Oriented point cloud
  
These filters and tool that converts the upsampled depth or disparity to a 3D object are done 12 pairs of images from KITTI dataset
Structure of this folder: 
  - otputs: some examples of output images for 4 filtering algorithms together with point clouds 
  - main.cpp and main.h: source code of project 
  - documentation: evaluation of results
